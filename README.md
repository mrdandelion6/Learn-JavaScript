# Learn JavaScript!

Welcome to my JavaScript learning repository! ðŸš€ This repository is a collection of my notes and code snippets as I embark on the journey of learning JavaScript.

## Contents
- `notes.js`: Dive into my detailed notes on various JavaScript concepts.
- `index.html` and `index.js`: These files were created for testing purposes during my learning process and may not be particularly useful.
- `compare.java`: This was created for comparing Java code syntax and behaviour against JavaScript during my learning process and may also not be particularly useful. 

## Interactive Site
Explore a simple interactive site I built using basic JavaScript! Check it out [here](https://mrdandelion6.github.io/Learn-JavaScript/). The code for this project can be found in the `increase-decrease` branch of this repository.

Feel free to clone the repository and experiment with the code. If you have any suggestions or find areas for improvement, don't hesitate to open an issue or pull request.

Happy coding.
